<h1> Probelms </h1>
<br> 
<br> 
I first install Ubuntu on the secondary SSD with /boot on the first SSD
Later, I completely format the first SSD and GHOST a Windows 8.1 on it.
But it won't boot up.
Next I installed a Windows 10 and it worked fine. But I can't get into Ubuntu. Even with grub rescue.

So here is the trick to purge the old grub in Ubuntu from LiveCD(flash drive) by chroot.

PS, chroot stands for change root. It pretend the path you changing to to be the toot /. So if you change root to another Ubuntu system, it allows you to get access to that Ubuntu and act as if you are running on it. 

<br> 

Main Idea
===
* 1. boot into LiveCD and select Try Ubuntu without install
* 2. setup the envirnment for chroot
* 3. run chroot command on local Ubuntu(the one on the hard drive that you can't boot into).
* 4. reboot and select grub as bootable in BIOS.
* 5. successfully go into grub and life is good again.
